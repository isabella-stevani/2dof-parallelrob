# Robust Control of a 2-DOF Parallel Mechanism
This project refers to the master thesis entitled "Robust Control of a 2-DOF Parallel Mechanism Combining Feedback Linearization and H-infinity Design" developed by Isabella Stevani with the supervision of Professor Diego Colón, both from the Laboratory of Automation and Control of the University of São Paulo - LAC/USP. More details about the control and modeling methodologies used in the codes presented here could be found at the master thesis qualification text available soon at Research Gate. 

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to combine feedback linearization and H-infinity design to achieve a robust control design with simple tuning and applicable to a wide range of nonlinear systems, specially robotic mechanisms with parallel architecture. The purposed robust control design must stabilize the system even in the presence of uncertain parameters in the mechanism model.
